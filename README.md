# draft-moskowitz-ecdsa-pki
This memo provides a guide for building a PKI (Public Key 
Infrastructure) using openSSL.  All certificates in this guide 
are ECDSA, P-256, with SHA256 certificates.  Along with common 
End Entity certificates, this guide provides instructions for 
creating IEEE 802.1AR iDevID Secure Device certificates.
